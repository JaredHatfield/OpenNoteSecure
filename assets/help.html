		<h1>Help</h1>
		<p>OpenNoteSecure is a simple application for encrypting text files using AES or DES encryption.</p>
		
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>First, you need to select an existing text file or create a new file.  Once you have selected a file, you need to choose an encryption algorithm.</p>
		<p>The default choice is no encryption which does not require a password.  Once you select an algorithm and enter in a password, OpenNoteSecure will attempt to decrypt the file.  If the file is empty you will be able to add text to the file which will be encrypted.</p>
		<p>After you have finished editing the text, you must save before backing out.  The text will be saved using the algorithm and password previously specified</p>
